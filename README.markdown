# numbertoggle

Fork of numbertoggle (jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle.git) allows you to quickly toggle between combined number with relativenumber to nonumbers at all. Rest of the original functionality was removed.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/marcindziedzic/vim-numbertoggle.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help numbertoggle`.
